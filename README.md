# RamseyStudents

This project was made using .NET 7 applying middleware to handle generic errors, repository pattern and base controller to apply the repository to any entity

Please run the .NET API using visual studio. Then to run the frontend go to https://github.com/juan18621/RamseyFrontend clone the project and open terminal to run:

1. npm install

2. ng serve -o to test the frontend.

NOTE: Keep running the API and the frontend at the same time for the app to work

The frontend project was made with a modular architecture using own component libraries (no external) and using Angular best practices such as lazy loading, http interceptors and reusable components.
